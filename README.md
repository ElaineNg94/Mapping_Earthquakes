# Mapping_Earthquakes
### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis was to make a map that shows earthquake data we got from the USGS website. The bigger the circle, the larger the magnitude. We also had to make at least three different layers for this map to display the data for people to visualize. We used the "L.tileLayer" code to make the box on the top right of the map for people to be able to choose what map style they want.
